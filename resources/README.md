## Changing keys
To change the keys go to VIA (https://usevia.app/) and you'll be able to change the keys to whatever you want.

If you want to change what the knobs do, you'll have to download the VIA software and run it. Additionally, you'll need to navigate to the setting and enable dev mode.

Once you've enabled it, you can use the json file and then edit the knobs in the leftmost tab.

## Issues and Warnings
DO NOT UNPLUG THE AUDIO JACK CABLE WHILE THE KEYBOARD IS PLUGGED IN

You may short it and brick half or the whole keyboard

If a key isn't working, it may be because the controller isn't pushed down and making good contact all the way. Push it down and see if that fixes it.
