## Issues and Warnings
DO NOT UNPLUG THE AUDIO JACK CABLE WHILE THE KEYBOARD IS PLUGGED IN

You may short it and brick half or the whole keyboard

If a key isn't working, it may be because the controller isn't pushed down and making good contact all the way. Push it down and see if that fixes it.
## Changing keys
To change the keys go to [VIA](https://usevia.app/) and you'll be able to change the keys to whatever you want.

To change what the rotary encoders do, you'll have to provide the keycodes of what you want them to do. While VIA will provide them to you in basic when you hover over them, a list of the can be found [here](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/keycodes.md)
